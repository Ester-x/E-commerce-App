The Android application that we have built is a prototype e-commerce app that allows users to browse products by category, view detailed product information, and manage a shopping cart. The app uses structured design principles with reusable components and Firebase integration for dynamic data loading. It features a splash screen, a home screen with sliders and categories, a product details view, and a functional cart system. Some sections like Favorites and Profile are present in the UI but are planned for future development.
